It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you are feeling and what kind of support you are looking for. Remember that everyone has their own way of showing support, and sometimes they may not understand what you need unless you express it clearly. If you need some time to process your emotions, it's okay to take a step back and focus on self-care. You can also consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you navigate this situation. Remember, you deserve to feel supported and valued in your relationships.",
